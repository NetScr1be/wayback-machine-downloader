If you want to use the distribution Ruby instead of rb-env/rvm, you can set up a GEM_HOME for your current user.

Start by creating a directory to store the Ruby gems for your user:

    $ mkdir ~/.ruby

Then update your shell to use that directory for GEM_HOME and to update your PATH variable to include the Ruby gem bin directory.

    $ echo 'export GEM_HOME=~/.ruby/' >> ~/.bashrc

    $ echo 'export PATH="$PATH:~/.ruby/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc

    $ source ~/.bashrc

(That last line will reload the environment variables in your current shell.)

Now you should be able to install Ruby gems under your user using the gem command.

I was able to get this working with Ruby 2.5.1 under Ubuntu 18.04.
